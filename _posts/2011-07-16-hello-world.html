    I plan to, mainly blog about the things I work on, namely, Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PostgreSQL, OpenLayers, HTML5/Compass(SCSS) and throw in a few other things if its worth the space. This blog of course has been put up using Jekyll and is also <a href = "http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">responsive</a>! I will be writing a blog post soon on how I got this blog setup.
