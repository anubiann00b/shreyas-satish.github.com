    I use Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PostgreSQL, OpenLayers and HTML5/Compass to develop web applications at work. This blog of course has been put up using Jekyll and is also <a href = "http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> ! I will be writing a blog post soon on how I got this blog setup.
