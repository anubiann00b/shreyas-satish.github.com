### Quick Intro 

* I'm primarily interested in the intersection of technology and human learning i.e How can we help people learn better, at _scale_?
* I'm currently working with [Dr Rajesh Kasturirangan](http://rajesh.io) on a [startup](http://knovie.com). 
* I have previously worked at [Mapunity](http://mapunity.in) as a product developer, some details of which are further below.
* If you would like to get in touch, please send an email to <shreyas.satish@gmail.com>.
* I live in Bangalore, India.

### Previous Projects

#### 1. Technagara

* Lead Developer on the project, at Mapunity.
* See
  * [Bangalore Governance Platform](http://bcity.in)
  * [Bangalore Heritage Platform](http://bangaloreheritage.in)
* Please see [this blog post](/blog/technagara) for my take on the project. 
* Some kind words from Mapunity's CEO, [Dr Ashwin Mahesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwin_Mahesh).
  
  > Shreyas built every piece of the system - the GIS base, the MIS overlay, the tracking system for individual conversations and issues on the social platform, the extensions we make available to other sites for publishing, all of it. He also did a really good job of keeping his eyes open for emerging tools, and looked for ways to integrate those into Technagara. We've been able to make a lot of progress by adopting stuff he discovered and running with it. I have no doubt that he'll do really well in different kinds of problem-solving. 

#### 2. Road Traffic Density Estimation

* Mentored a project team at the college I studied in. Suggested the point of research, helped the team with picking the right technologies, and provided regular feedback to the team.
* The project used support vector machines (a machine learning technique) to estimate traffic density (low or high) using traffic camera images. 
* This project was [awarded](http://jed-i.in/challenge/2013/winners) as the 'best project in computing' at IISC, Bangalore.
* Last author on the accompanying [research paper](http://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?Real-time-Traffic-Congestion-Detection-using-Combined-SVM.pdf).

#### 3. Fleet Tracking System

* Developed at Mapunity. Contributed to the project by developing a component that monitors vehicle positions and sends alerts on certain events.

#### 4. CitizenMatters

* Developed (at Mapunity) the media management component for the Admin interface of [CitizenMatters](http://citizenmatters.in).

#### 5. WorldView

* Developed as a side project while at Mapunity. Extracted common boiler-plate code while working with maps, into an open source library. Source code is on [Github](https://github.com/shreyas-satish/worldview).

#### 6. HELP

* Worked on at eLitmus Evaluations as part of the final year project during my undergraduate engineering program, along with [Kartik Rao](http://karthikrao.in).
* Developed a semantic search engine in Ruby, while using Wordnet for its synonym database. The search engine returned significantly better search results compared to the existing text matching search engine.
