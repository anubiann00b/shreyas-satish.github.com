### Previous Projects

#### 1. Technagara

* Worked on while at Mapunity, as Lead Developer. Developed the project from scratch and continually developed the project from June, 2011 to July, 2013.
* See
  * [Bangalore Governance Platform](http://bcity.in)
  * [Bangalore Heritage Platform](http://bangaloreheritage.in)
* Please see [this blog post](/blog/technagara) for an elaborate description of my take on the project. 
* Some kind words from Mapunity's CEO, Dr Ashwin Mahesh.
  
  > Shreyas built every piece of the system - the GIS base, the MIS overlay, the tracking system for individual conversations and issues on the social platform, the extensions we make available to other sites for publishing, all of it. He also did a really good job of keeping his eyes open for emerging tools, and looked for ways to integrate those into Technagara. We've been able to make a lot of progress by adopting stuff he discovered and running with it. I have no doubt he'll excel in any class that he finds himself in, and that he'll do really well in different kinds of problem-solving. 

#### 2. Road Traffic Density Estimation

* Mentored a project team at the college I studied in. Suggested the point of research, and did some research on the language and libraries to be used. Did my best in providing as much data the algorithms needed and gave regular feedback to the team.
* The project used support vector machines (a machine learning technique) to parse traffic camera images and estimate traffic density (low or high). 
* This project won a major All India award at IISC, Bangalore.
* Last author on the accompanying research paper.

#### 3. Fleet Tracking System

* Worked on at Mapunity. Contributed to the project by developing a component that monitors vehicle positions and sends alerts on certain events.

#### 4. CitizenMatters

* Worked on at Mapunity. Developed a media management component for the Admin interface of [CitizenMatters](http://citizenmatters.in).

#### 5. WorldView

* Developed as a side project while at Mapunity.
* Extracted common boiler-plate code while working with maps, into an open source library.

#### 6. HELP

* Final year project in my undergraduate engineering program. Worked on at eLitmus Evaluations, along with [Kartik Rao](http://karthikrao.in).
* Developed a semantic search engine that returned better search results to user queries compared to a text matching search engine. Wrote the engine in Ruby and used the WordNet database to construct vocabularies.
