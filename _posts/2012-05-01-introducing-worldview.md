&#x20; <a href = "https://github.com/shreyas-satish/worldview" target="_blank">WorldView</a> is a little library I wrote, to make using <a href = "http://openlayers.org" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> for a set of common use cases with maps, **easy**. OpenLayers is of course a great mapping library, but it can be intimidating at times to perform some basic cases even. Christopher Schmidt, one of the lead developers of OpenLayers had this to say :

> The OpenLayers API is difficult to get started with for many simple problems. It can be hard to use, confusing to start, and difficult to understand for solving simple problems. 

He also adds,

> It is crucially important to supporting the future use of the project to make the easy things easy, while maintaining the ability to make the hard things possible.

This really struck home with me, which is why I cared enough to write WorldView. By giving you a clear and easy-to-use set of APIs to solve common use cases with maps, and allowing access to OpenLayers' objects for any advanced jazz, WorldView does exactly that - keep the easy things easy, and make the difficult things possible. More concretely, WorldView wraps/returns OpenLayers objects, so that, in case you'd like to do something that WorldView does not support natively, you can still do that with OpenLayers. 

Now, you're probably wondering - why not [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)? Sure, Leaflet is great, I've used it and I probably will even prefer that when I'm doing something that's perhaps targeted more towards mobile. Best tool for the job and all that. On the other hand, here's a <a href = 'http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/8048' target = '_blank'>great take</a> on why OpenLayers is a superior choice when it comes to writing GIS applications. Basically, it is a lot more feature-rich and a much more advanced mapping library compared to Leaflet. In addition to that, we've invested quite a bit into OpenLayers at  <a href = 'http://mapunity.in/' target = '_blank'>Mapunity</a> (where I work) and we intend to continue to use OpenLayers.

Sliding into a tangent, I quite enjoyed the _process_ of writing WorldView. I was curious about the  <a href = 'http://shreyas.io/worldview/' target = '_blank'>APIs</a> I would eventually want to use; I wrote down _those_ APIs first, and then coded it out so that they would actually work. Also, I chose to write WorldView in  <a href="http://coffeescript.org" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>, simply because it was quite a bit of fun. Debugging wasn't a problem at all since the JavaScript generated by CoffeeScript is very read-able. <a href = 'http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/' target='_blank'>Source Maps</a> will probably make debugging CoffeeScript even easier.

I'd like to add that, even though WorldView is written in CoffeeScript. you DO NOT need to use CoffeeScript to use this library; I've included the worldview.js in the source. Finally, I've been using WorldView (along with OpenLayers of course) at work and it has made my life much easier when I'm dealing with maps.
