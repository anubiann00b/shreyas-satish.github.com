  I'm Shreyas Satish, 24 and I live in Bangalore, India. I work as an engineer at <a href = "http://mapunity.in" target="_blank">Mapunity</a>. I graduated in 2010 from <a href = "http://bnmit.org" target="_blank">BNMIT</a> (VTU), Bangalore, India with an engineering degree in Information Science.

  At Mapunity, I'm currently developing <a href="http://technagara.in" target="_blank">Technagara</a>, a City Management System, a Bangalore instance of which, is <a href = "http://bcity.in" target="_blank">bcity</a>.

  I love and use Open Source software. I usually program in Ruby, JavaScript and CoffeeScript. I've been fortunate to been using some awesome libraries/frameworks like Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Open Layers for a while now. Also,  I'm currently developing <a href="http://github.com/shreyas-satish/worldview" target="_blank">WorldView</a>, a wrapper/extension to OpenLayers to make working with OpenLayers, hence maps, trivial.

  <p>
  When not geeking out, I'm usually following football (soccer). I'm a <a href = "http://chelseafc.com" target="_blank">Chelsea F.C </a> fan.
