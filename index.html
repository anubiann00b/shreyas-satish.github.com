  I'm Shreyas Satish and an engineer at <a href = "http://mapunity.in" target="_blank">Mapunity</a>. I graduated in 2010 from <a href = "http://bnmit.org" target="_blank">BNMIT</a> (VTU), Bangalore, India with an engineering degree in Information Science.

  <p>
  At Mapunity, I'm currently developing Technagara, a City Management/Information System, a Bangalore instance of which, is <a href = "http://bcity.in" target="_blank">bcity</a>.
  Technagara aims to engage civil socities in governance, by giving them a platform to report and discuss issues, access Governance based news articles, track ongoing projects in cities and download Govenment forms.<br>
  This app uses a stack of PostgreSQL, Ruby, Rails, jQuery, OpenLayers and HTML5.

  <p>
  I love and use OpenSource software. I'm currently developing <a href="http://github.com/shreyas-satish/worldview" target="_blank">WorldView</a>, a wrapper/extension to OpenLayers to make working with OpenLayers, hence maps, trivial.

  When not geeking out, I'm usually following football (soccer). I'm a <a href = "http://chelseafc.com" target="_blank">Chelsea F.C </a> fan.
