  <p>
  I'm Shreyas Satish and an engineer at <a href = "http://mapunity.in">Mapunity</a>. I graduated in 2010 from <a href = "http://bnmit.org">BNMIT</a> (VTU), Bangalore, India with an engineering degree in Information Science (In India, this degree is analogous to the Computer Science degree, with more focus on Software Engineering based courses).

  <p>
  At Mapunity, I'm currently developing Technagara, a City Management/Information System, a Bangalore instance of which, is <a href = "http://bcity.in">bcity</a>.
  Technagara aims to engage civil socities in governance, by giving them a platform to report and discuss issues, access Governance based news articles, track ongoing projects in cities and download Govenment forms.
  This app uses a stack of PostgreSQL, Ruby (REE 1.8.7), Rails (3.0.7), jQuery (1.7.1) and HTML5.

  <p>
  I love and use OpenSource software. I'm currently developing <a href="http://github.com/shreyas-satish/worldview">WorldView</a>, a wrapper/extension to OpenLayers to make working with OpenLayers, hence maps, trivial.

  <p>
  When not geeking out, I'm usually following football (soccer). I'm a <a href = "http://chelseafc.com">Chelsea F.C </a> fan.
